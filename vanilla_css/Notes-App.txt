###Day 1

-This will be a template configurator for my own projects;
-Requirements (initial)


-client can choose between pre-defined components to make a template;
-components are configurable (2 initial 'versions of templates' with 2 radically different collor schemas/design concepts)
-besides initial configuration, client can replace the component text with his own (click event);
-template is saved as archive on the client;
-note sure yet if it will be generating a single page app/teplate or multiple;


-next step would be for client to be able to upload an image and use it for a component;
-use materialize CSS or make everything custom from scratch;
-define a master sandbox for workflow;
